Utility Functions for Flight Data ETL Pipeline

This module contains helper functions for extracting, transforming, and loading
flight data from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. It uses DuckDB for efficient in-memory
data transformations and provides various SQL queries for computing KPIs and
aggregations.

Functions:
    fetch_table_from_postresql: Extract data from PostgreSQL and save to CSV
    compute: Execute SQL queries on CSV data and save results as JSON
    serialize: Helper function for JSON serialization of datetime and Decimal types
    load_to_mongo: Load JSON data into MongoDB collections
    clean_up_files: Remove temporary CSV and JSON files from dump directory

SQL Queries:
    The module defines various SQL queries for computing metrics:
    - total_flights_per_week: Count flights per week
    - delayed_flights_per_week: Count delayed flights per week
    - average_delay_time_per_week: Average delay in minutes per week
    - flights_over_time: Daily flight counts
    - top_airports_by_departures: Top 10 airports by departure count
    - average_passengers_per_flight_per_week: Average passenger count per week
    - last_weeks_revenue: Total revenue per week
    - flights_lines: Flight routes with geographic coordinates
